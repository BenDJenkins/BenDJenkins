- 🔭 I am currently a postdoctorate researcher with a fellowship from the Royal Society and JSPS.
- 🌱 I am blending my knowledge of DEM simulation with deep knowledge of powder materials.
- 💬 I love everything about space and rocketry as well as electronics and microcontrollers!
- ‍🎓 I am currently learning advanced Julia for optimal code performance and researching calibration of complex DEM simulation contact models such as the EEPA with limited experimental data.

## Skills
- Mastery over several DEM packages including LIGGGHTS, Blaze-DEM and EDEM, and development knowledge of DEM engines in Stella.
- Proficient in Python, Julia and data visulisation. I love making super pretty scientific graphs, which are also efficient at conveying knowledge and meaning.
- Extensive knowlege of machine learning for regression based tasks using scientific data in Python with some new expereince with Julia.
- Expertise in big data analytics and statistics like principal component analysis, sensitivity analysis and developing custom scripts for filtering data.
